feat: Arduino interactive monster box - sensor-controlled servo animations

🎭 Interactive toy system for Arduino Nano:
Monster pops out of trash can when obstacle detected by VL53L0X sensor.
Two servo motors control "hand" and "monster" movements with synchronized LED effects.

🎯 Features:
- Laser distance sensor (VL53L0X) detects objects < 8cm
- 6 different monster animation sequences with varying speeds
- Synchronized LED lighting (green=calm, red=scary)
- Debounced detection requiring 8 consecutive measurements
- Advanced servo control with configurable movement speeds
- Memory-optimized design using PROGMEM for sequence data

🔧 Hardware:
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
- VL53L0X laser distance sensor (I2C)
- 2x servo motors for animated movement
- 2x LEDs (green/red) for visual effects
- Optimized for stable operation within 2KB RAM limit

🎮 Operation:
Wave hand near sensor → Monster jumps out with scary effects → Returns to hiding after sequence
